The Let's Encrypt process uses two terminals. In the first terminal, the
'letsencrypt' program runs and tells you to do things. In the second
terminal you do what the 'letsencrypt' program says, like create files
with particular content.

It is also OK to execute the procedure multiple times while learning the
process. Let's Encrypt will issue a new certificate on a second or third run.

The process below reuses the existing web server keypair for key continuity.
We need to be mindful of unexpected key changes due to Public-Key-Pins
header used for HTTP public key pinning.

Be sure to restart Apache after the process so the new certificate is used.

1. Log-in to VM, su to root with "sudo su -".
   CD to root's home with "cd ~".
   An existing CSR using the existing key is in Home.

2. Open a second terminal, su to root.
   CD to /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/.
   Remove past challenges.

3. letsencrypt --manual --email webmaster@cryptopp.com --csr ~/cryptopp-com.req.pem auth
   This terminal is now occupied by LE client.
   LE client will send requests and receive responses.

   LE client will tell you to create a file with specific content.
   Create the necessary files in the other terminal. Once the
   challenges have been accepted client will download a new cert.

4. Before the final OK, check permissions on the files the LE Client
   asked you to create. The owner of the files should be root:apache.
   The permissions should be u=rw,g=r,o=.

5. Once the certificate issues, copy it to cryptopp-com.cert.pem

   # cp 0000_cert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/cryptopp-com.cert.pem
   cp: overwrite ‘/etc/pki/tls/certs/cryptopp-com.cert.pem’? y

   The existing chain should be OK, but it can be copied if desired.
   Test the website. Once tested it is OK to delete the local
   Let's Encrypt artifacts in Home.

6. Restart the Apache web server

   systemctl restart httpd24-httpd.service

7. Verify the new web server certificate.
