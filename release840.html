  <h2>Crypto++ 8.4</h2>
  <p>Crypto++ 8.4 was released on January NN, 2021. The 8.4 release was a minor, planned
  release. There was no CVEs and one memory error fixed.</p>
  <p>The Crypto++ 8.4 release reverted the changes for constant-time elliptic curve
  algorithms. Marcel Keller reported some operations broke under the new algorithm in
  <a href="https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/992">Issue 992</a>. The revert
  reactivated CVE-2019-14318.</p>
  <p>The release also cleared a memory error reported by Daniel McRobb in <a href=
  "https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/988">Issue 988</a>. McRobb discovered
  <tt>FixedSizeAllocatorWithCleanup</tt> could write to memory outside of the allocation
  if the allocated memory was not 16-byte aligned.</p>
  <h2>Download</h2>

  <h2>Bug fixes and Minor Issues</h2>
  <p>The bug fix and minor issue list for Crypto++ 8.4 follows. Many non-trivial issues
  are tracked for auditing and C&amp;A purposes, but the list may not be complete. A
  number in parenthesis is the <a href=
  "http://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues">GitHub Issue number</a>, if it was
  tracked. Sometimes a Git commit is referenced, but many trivial GitHub commits are
  omitted. Missing Issue numbers or lack of consecutiveness usually indicates feature
  requests and "won't fix/can't fix" type reports.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>fix SIGILL on POWER8 when compiling with GCC 10 (GH #986)</li>
    <li>fix potential out-of-bounds write in <tt>FixedSizeAllocatorWithCleanup</tt> (GH
    #988)</li>
    <li>fix compile on AIX POWER7 with IBM XLC 12.01 (Commit 4577311727f2)</li>
    <li>fix compile on Solaris with SunCC 12.6 (PR #990)</li>
    <li>revert changes for constant-time elliptic curve algorithms (GH #992,
    CVE-2019-14318)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>CVE-2019-14318</h2>
  <p>Marcel Keller discovered recent contant-time elliptic curve changes checked-in under
  <a href="https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/862">Issue 862</a> broke some
  operations. As a hotfix the contant-time code was reverted, which means CVE-2019-14318
  is active again. The break and CVE-2019-14318 are being tracked under <a href=
  "https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/994">Issue 994</a>.</p>
  <h2>Memory error</h2>
  <p>Daniel McRobb discovered <tt>FixedSizeAllocatorWithCleanup</tt> could write to
  memory outside of the allocation if the allocated memory was not 16-byte aligned. The
  <tt>FixedSizeAllocatorWithCleanup</tt> typically has an allocation on the stack, and
  not the heap. The impact of the memory error was lessened because
  <tt>FixedSizeAllocatorWithCleanup</tt> is typically used for table data with a known
  size, like the state of BLAKE2s or BLAKE2b hash. Attackers generally don't have direct
  access to the pointer. However, an attacker who can find a message (preimage) that
  hashes to a particular string (image) may be able to control an address.</p>
  <p>Based on research of older Crypto++, it appears the issue affects Crypto++ 5.6 and
  forward. Crypto++ 5.6 was released March 2009.</p>
  <p>The issue was tracked under <a href=
  "https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/988">Issue 988</a>. No CVE was assigned
  because the web form at https://cveform.mitre.org would not submit. We then tried to
  email cve@mitre.org but the email response directed us to the webform.</p>
  <h2>Configure.sh script</h2>
  <p>The Crypto++ 8.3 release added a <tt>configure.sh</tt> script. The script helps fix
  misdetected features on Android, Clang, OS X and iOS. You should use the script before
  a build if the library misdetects features for you.</p>
  <p>The script fixes misdetected features by rewriting <tt>config_asm.h</tt> and
  <tt>config_cxx.h</tt> for the platform it is run on. To run the script perform these
  steps. You should set <tt>CXX</tt> and <tt>CXXFLAGS</tt> to your preferred flags before
  running the script.</p>
  <pre>
$ cp -p TestScripts/configure.sh .
$ CXX=g++ ./configure.sh
Configuring for x86_64
Compiler: /usr/bin/g++
Linker: /usr/bin/ld
Done writing config_asm.h
Done writing config_cxx.h
</pre>
  <p>The <tt>configure.sh</tt> script is located in <tt>TestScripts/</tt>. It was placed
  there to avoid confusing users because the script is usually not needed.</p>
  <p>A wiki page is available at <a href=
  "https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Configure.sh">Configure.sh script</a>.</p>
  <h2>X.509 Certificate interface</h2>
  <p>Crypto++ 8.3 was modified to support certificates by way of a <tt>Certificate</tt>
  base class. The library does not provide concrete certificate classes, however. An
  X.509 Certificate class is available as an add-on at <a href=
  "https://github.com/noloader/cryptopp-pem">noloader | cryptopp-pem</a>.</p>
  <h2>FIPS DLL deprecation</h2>
  <p>The FIPS DLL used to be an important artifact for Windows builds. NIST moved the
  Crypto++ library to the Historical Validation List in 2014. The Windows DLL is no
  longer validated.</p>
  <p>The project files to build the FIPS DLL are <tt>cryptdll.vcxproj</tt> and
  <tt>dlltest.vcxproj</tt>. The projects are now deprecated and subject to removal.</p>
  <h2>File Changes</h2>
  <p>No files were added or removed at Crypto++ 8.4.</p>
