On occasion the webserver experiences questionable behavior from some clients.
For example:

# journalctl -xe | grep 31.210.20.203
...
Apr 04 00:36:31 localhost sshd[722652]: Disconnected from invalid user centos 31.210.20.203 port 49328 [preauth]
Apr 04 00:41:48 localhost sshd[722714]: Invalid user centos from 31.210.20.203 port 38166
Apr 04 00:41:49 localhost sshd[722714]: Received disconnect from 31.210.20.203 port 38166:11: Normal Shutdown, Thank you for playing
...

The host at 31.210.20.203 is attempting to break into the webserver by trying different usernames and passwords, like centos, ubuntu, test, test1, etc.

It is OK to block misbehaving hosts. To block a host, determine the netblock
information for the host:

  $ whois 31.210.20.203 | grep -E 'inetnum|route'
  inetnum:        31.210.20.0 - 31.210.21.255
  route:          31.210.20.0/24

If the netblock is missing, then visit https://ipinfo.io/. IpInfo should be
able to provide the missing information.

Second, send an email to the Whois contacts and inform them the netblock is
being banned. Tell them the ban will be lifted if they tend to their
misbehaving host and fix their network monitoring.

  $ whois 31.210.20.203 | grep '@'
  % Abuse contact for '31.210.20.0 - 31.210.21.255' is 'abuse@serverion.com'
  abuse-mailbox:  abuse@serverion.com

Don't worry if you don't receive a response. Accurate administrative and
technical contact information is an ICANN contractual requirement. It is the
organization's responsibility to provide accurate information.

Third, open /etc/iptables/rules.v4 and ban the netblock. Add the netblock
before traffic is accepted. I.e., place the Deny rule before the Allow rules.

  # Constant probes by hosts in the Netherlands
  -A INPUT -p all -s 31.210.20.0/24 -j DROP

China Mobile, Chinanet and Digital Ocean are a constant source of problems.
After we reported several problem hosts to China Mobile, China Mobile blocked
our reports to abuse@ by bouncing our emails.

China Mobile has a permanent ban:

  # Permanent ban from China Mobile (AS9808)
  -A INPUT -p all -s 111.0.0.0/10 -j DROP
  -A INPUT -p all -s 221.176.0.0/13 -j DROP
  -A INPUT -p all -s 221.130.0.0/15 -j DROP
  -A INPUT -p all -s 223.119.255.0/24 -j DROP

After adding a network reload iptables:

  systemctl restart iptables

Finally, verify the new rule:

  # iptables -L
  Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
  target     prot opt source               destination
  DROP       all  --  221.176.0.0/13       anywhere
  ...

If the site's administrator states they have tended to their host, then remove
the ban. The ban is intended to protect the Crypto++ webserver. The ban is not
punitive.
