Installing a new version of Mediawiki sucks for a several reasons.
First, it happens too frequently. Second, we have to disable some
of our security hardening and re-enable it later. Third, we have to
install a bunch of developer tools and then remove them. Fourth,
Mediawiki uses bleeding edge components but CentOS provides
antique software.

You should set aside about 30 minutes to one hour for the migration.
The process itself is copy/paste and should take about 10 minutes
after the backup. Unfortunately something usually breaks even on minor
version bumps. You will most likely need extra fiddling time.

In the instructions below the Crypto++ Wiki is located at
/var/www/html/w. https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki works because
of an Apache mod-rewrite rule.

Step 1 - Get root
=================

1. sudo su -

Step 2 - Clear pending jobs
===========================

Some actions in the database are delayed. Run them now.

1. php /var/www/html/w/maintenance/runJobs.php

Step 3 - Incremental backup
===========================

1. bash /etc/cron.daily/bitvise-backup

The backup takes about 20 to 25 minutes.

Step 4 - Local backup of wiki only
==================================

Delete a previous local backup, if present. Make a local backup
for quick restoration, if needed.

Note: the backup is stored at /var/wiki-backup so /var/www/html
can be restored quickly without the need to restore a local backup.

1. rm -rf /var/wiki-backup
2. cp -r /var/www/html/w /var/wiki-backup
3. chown root:root /var/wiki-backup

Do not skip the backup step. Later you will need LocalSettings.php
from the local backup.

Step 5 - Delete the Vendor directory
====================================

Delete the current vendor directory. It holds code and tools for
the previous version of the Mediawiki software. New versions will
be installed using Composer.

1. rm -rf /var/www/html/w/vendor/*

Step 6 - Install Composer
=========================

# This gets an old Composer with dependencies.
# Red Hat SCL does not supply an updated composer.

1. yum -y install composer
2. hash -r
3. Copy the list of dependencies

Step (1) is dangerous. Composer is a developer tool that brings
in 30+ dependencies. Composer and friends require unsafe functions.
They must be removed after the Mediawiki upgrade.

Step 7 - Disable server hardening
=================================

Composer needs access to directories and functions we have disabled.
Temporarily renable them for Composer.

1. cp /etc/opt/rh/rh-php72/php.d/security.ini.weak /etc/opt/rh/rh-php72/php.d/security.ini

security.ini.weak allows:
   - open_basedir=<any>
   - allow_url_fopen=On
   - allow_url_include=On
   - disable_functions=<none>

Step (1) is dangerous. It allows many popular attack vectors.
This change must be undone after Composer has been run.

Step 8 - Install latest Mediawiki
==================================

Clear old artifacts:

1. rm -rf /tmp/mediawiki* /tmp/w/

Temporary unpack:

2. cd /tmp
3. wget https://releases.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.34/mediawiki-1.34.4.tar.gz
4. tar -xzf mediawiki-1.34.4.tar.gz
5. mv mediawiki-1.34.4/ w
6. rsync -avh --dry-run /tmp/w /var/www/html/

And then:

7. rsync -avh /tmp/w /var/www/html/

It is OK to delete the artifacts in /tmp:

8. rm -rf /tmp/mediawiki* /tmp/w/

Step 9 - Update Mediawiki dependencies
======================================

Use Composer to update Mediawiki dependencies. This is needed
because the release tarball does not include them.

1. cd /var/www/html/w/
2. php -d extension=phar.so composer.phar update

Step (2) is dangerous. It runs Composer as root, and does not
disable plugins or scripts in the third-party projects. The
third-party projects effectively have full control over
the web server and virtual machine.

If you experience errors in vendor/ then revisit Step (5).

Step 10 - Restore LocalSettings.php
===================================

The backup of LocalSettings.php is in /var/wiki-backup.

Make a backup of the new LocalSettings.php in case it is needed.

1. cp LocalSettings.php LocalSettings.php.orig
2. cp /var/wiki-backup/LocalSettings.php .

Note: Mediawiki does not provide a LocalSettings.php in the
tarball. You have to use the existing LocalSettings.php that
was backed up in Step 4.

Step 11 - Update for new Mediawiki
==================================

1. Open update-wiki.sh
2. Change WIKI_REL=REL1_34 to appropriate version

update-wiki.sh is available in this GitHub repo.

Next, cross your fingers:

3. php /var/www/html/w/maintenance/update.php

And then:

4. bash /var/www/html/w/update-wiki.sh

maintenance/update.php must succeed or the migration is a failure.
You must fix failures or go back to the down-level version of
MediaWiki saved at /var/wiki-backup.

The head notes cover what update-wiki.sh does. It includes
updating the components in skins/ and extensions/, running
maintenance/update.php, and fixing permissions.

The script also restarts MySQL and Apache.

At this point you should be able to test the installation by
visiting Special:Version:

5. https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Special:Version

Step 12 - Restore server hardening
=================================

1. cp /etc/opt/rh/rh-php72/php.d/security.ini.hard /etc/opt/rh/rh-php72/php.d/security.ini

security.ini.hard re-enables:
   - open_basedir="..."
   - allow_url_fopen=Off
   - allow_url_include=Off
   - disable_functions="apache_note ..."

Step 13 - Remove Composer
=========================

The list from Step (5) should be cribbed away. Here is the one
produced by CentOS 7 during install:

1. yum -y remove composer php-PsrLog php-cli php-common \
php-composer-ca-bundle php-composer-semver php-composer-spdx-licenses \
php-composer-xdebug-handler php-fedora-autoloader php-gd php-intl \
php-jsonlint php-justinrainbow-json-schema5 php-mbstring \
php-paragonie-random-compat php-password-compat php-pdo php-process \
php-seld-phar-utils php-symfony-browser-kit php-symfony-class-loader \
php-symfony-common php-symfony-config php-symfony-console \
php-symfony-css-selector php-symfony-debug php-symfony-dependency-injection \
php-symfony-dom-crawler php-symfony-event-dispatcher \
php-symfony-expression-language php-symfony-filesystem php-symfony-finder \
php-symfony-http-foundation php-symfony-http-kernel php-symfony-polyfill \
php-symfony-process php-symfony-var-dumper php-symfony-yaml php-xml

2. hash -r

3. yum -y autoremove
